					Based on the HHS mission, grant program descriptions, and the CFDA guidelines, the TAGGS system uses 16
					activity types to characterize the nature of the grant being funded. For the purpose of this report, these
					16 have been grouped into four major activity types (Research, Services, Training, and Other). HHS OPDIVs
					self-select the activity type for awards based on the primary purpose of the grant.
